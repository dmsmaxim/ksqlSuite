# About

ksqLight is an open-source tool for **monitoring your ksqlDB queries and messages in real-time**. Its interactive dashboard visualizes ksqlDB query and messages metrics, to help in diagnosing stream processing bottlenecks and identifying network issues.

Under the hood, it uses Prometheus to pull the relevant metrics from ksqlDB server.

# Setup

> **Note**
> This app assumes you have access to a working ksqlDB server and a Prometheus instance scraping metrics from ksqlDB server via JMX exporter. If you need a reference on how to do that, please check out the `ksqLight/exampleContainers` folder.

## Clone repo, cd into it, then run:

```

npm run electron:serve

```

Upon startup, enter the Prometheus url into the pop-up (or you can enter it on the settings modal).

The duration and refresh rate for the time-series charts can be configured on the settings modal.

To submit SQL queries to ksqlDB server, the server url needs to be entered in settings.
